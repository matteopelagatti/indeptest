-   **banchmarking.R** compares the computation times of the five tests. It produces Figure 7.
-   **BrainInjury_mod.R** carries out the computations for the application in Section 7.2. The application data were kindly provided by Prof. Christian Genest and we may not share them.
-   **cardiomyopathy.R** carries out the computations for the application in Section 7.3.
-   **example_of_deformation_plots.R** produces the plots of Section 2.5.
-   **feature.case#.R**, \*\*feature.case#\_ultra.R**,** feature.case#\_ultra5.R\*\* with **case#** ranging from **case1** through **case8** carry out the computations in Section 6.
-   **feature.screen.out.R** produces the tables of Section 6, after running the script of the preceding line.
-   **gendataRegMod.R** generates the simulated data used in Section 6.
-   **indeptest_with_cat.R** contains the main functions to compute our independence test: **indeptest()** runs the test while **depanalysis** runs the test and returns ggplot objects to plot the deformation plots of Section 2.5.
-   **libraries.R** is just a utulity script to load the packages that are often used in our analyses.
-   **noise.distributions.R** simulates from the 10 dependence schemes in Section 4.
-   **power_nominal_var.R** produces the power plots for the nomial variables case as in Fugure 6.
-   **power_simulations.R** carries out the power comparison for continuous random variables and produces the plots in Figure 5.
-   **utilities.R** contains utility functions sometimes called by other scripts.
